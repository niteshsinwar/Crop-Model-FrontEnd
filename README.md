# Crop Prediction App

This project is a Crop Prediction App built with Create React App. It provides a user interface for predicting the type of crop suitable for a given set of input parameters related to soil and weather conditions.

## Description

The Crop Prediction App is designed to assist farmers and agriculture professionals in making informed decisions about the choice of crops to plant based on various environmental factors. By inputting specific parameters such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels in the soil, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall, the app predicts the most suitable crop for the given conditions.

The app utilizes a machine learning model trained on historical data to make accurate crop recommendations. It provides a user-friendly interface for inputting the necessary data and displays the predicted crop as the output.

## Inputs

The following parameters are required as input for the Crop Prediction App:

- Nitrogen level in the soil
- Phosphorus level in the soil
- Potassium level in the soil
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH level
- Rainfall

Users can input these values through a form in the app's user interface.

## Output

Based on the provided input parameters, the Crop Prediction App will predict the most suitable crop for the given conditions. The predicted crop will be displayed to the user as the output.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
